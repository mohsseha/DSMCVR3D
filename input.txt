#***** >>> Common things to modify <<<
#total number of simulation steps 
totalSteps=500 
#number of particles/cell
pkPerCell=4500
# Steady state results are -1 means that startSSSampling=endTransSampling
startSSSampling=-1
#this is the time step in units of MTBC
relativeDt=0.166666666666666666666666
#estimated average number of particles per epsilon; this is |S_i| in our papers and thesis:
PKS_EPS=10
#temperature BC is TRef-dT and TRef+dT
dT=10
# Moving wall boundary condition 
NormalizedWallSpeed=0.000000000
#number of cells in the y direction
celly=60
#domain width in units of MFP 
NormalizedLy=10




#***** >>> Physical gas properties  
dia=0.4e-9
n0Ref=1.4e17
mass=5.e-26
TRef=300



#***** >>> Less common:
#number of copies of the simulation to run. The code will automatically average all values when giving results
totalEnsembles=10000
#results for steps 0 to this value are independently kept track of 
endTransSampling=91
#make sure you use "true" instead of "true " (i.e. with space). Same goes for false
#if regular DMSC the weights are all set to 1.0 and VR results are worthless. If not regular DSMC stabilization is auto selected. 
regularDSMC=false
#this parameter ctl's eps_y ie. the distance in the y direction for smearing 
homolleIC=false
# determines if we save the whole state of the calculation (so we can restart it or debug it) or just the resutls
deleteRestart=true
# Either way restart files are created incrementally (they'r just deleted at the end). 
refState=1
cellx=1
cellz=1
NormalizedLx=1
NormalizedLz=1




#***** >>> You probably don't want to touch these:
#random seed if it's -1 the computer will choose one randomly
randomSeed=-1
#this is the number of particles in an average NN cell; this will not affect the result at all and will only make things slightly faster or slower. See appendix of thesis
defPkVCell=6
